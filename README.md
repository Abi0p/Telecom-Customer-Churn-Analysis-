# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-
This project provides a comprehensive walkthrough for building a churn analysis solution using ETL (SQL Server), analytics and visualization (Power BI), and machine learning (Random Forest with Python). 
ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical KPI for businesses. This project guides you through:

1.ETL of telecom customer data using SQL Server

2.Data exploration and cleaning

3.Visual analytics in Power BI (demographic, geographic, account, and service patterns)

4.Building a Random Forest churn prediction model in Python/Jupyter (scikit-learn)

5.Visualizing predicted churners alongside historical churn in interactive dashboards

6.The approach and techniques here apply to ANY industry that values customer retention.
